-- TPB Creative Reactor — Clone & Iterate taxonomy analytics (OPTIONAL)
--
-- The app already reads and writes the fixed creative taxonomy and test IDs
-- INSIDE the existing `campaign_outcomes.concept` jsonb (under
-- concept.attributes.taxonomy / .testId), following this codebase's convention of
-- folding structured attributes into jsonb so no migration is required. Demo mode
-- and every runtime path work WITHOUT running this file.
--
-- This migration is purely for humans/BI who want to GROUP BY taxonomy in raw
-- SQL. The columns are GENERATED (always in sync with the jsonb the app writes),
-- so there is nothing extra for the application to populate. Idempotent — safe to
-- run more than once. Run in the Supabase SQL editor.

-- One value per axis, extracted from the concept jsonb the Reactor already writes.

-- The isolation test a concept ran under (e.g. "RXN-42") and the variant within
-- it (e.g. "RXN-42-B"), so results attribute back to the hypothesis being tested.
