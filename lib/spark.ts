// SPARK — Creative Intelligence. Studies winning creatives (ads, UGC, founder
// videos, testimonials) and extracts repeatable Creative DNA — patterns, not
// files. The DNA is stored back into the knowledge layer as `creative` chunks so
// OPUS can retrieve "what has already worked" on future runs.
//
// SPARK reads two ways:
//   - WRITTEN — a script, transcript, or notes (`extractCreativeDNA`).
//   - VISUAL  — the ad itself, seen by a vision model (`extractVisualDNA`):
//     the palette, the layout, where the headline sits, what it says, the
//     bullets, where the hook lands, and WHY the design stops the scroll.
//
// The visual read is what lets OPUS design the next ad rather than only write
// it — `visualDirectionBlock` (lib/taxonomy.ts) carries it into the production
// brief the image models render from.

- Account for EVERY vivid measured colour. A saturated colour covering only a few percent of the frame is almost always the scroll-stop device — a red band behind one word, a yellow CTA pill, a green tick row. Dropping it is the single worst mistake you can make here.
- On a multi-ad sheet the measured list spans the whole screenshot, so assign each colour to the ad that actually uses it and leave it off the others.`

You are looking at ${count > 1 ? `${count} images` : 'an image'} of winning ad creatives. Read them the way a senior art director reverse-engineers a competitor's control ads.

FIRST, SEPARATE THE ADS. An image may hold ONE ad, or it may be a screenshot of a board, swipe file, ad-library grid or contact sheet holding SEVERAL distinct ads laid out in a grid. Identify every distinct ad creative across everything you are shown, and analyze EACH ONE SEPARATELY.
- One entry per distinct ad. NEVER merge two different ads into a single entry, and never split one ad into several.
- A single ad keeps its own panels together: a before/after pair, a multi-panel comparison, or a carousel frame set belongs to ONE ad.
- Give each entry a short "label" that identifies it by position and a distinguishing feature ("Top-left — orange headline, hard-hat photo") so a human can match the entry to the ad on screen.
- Work left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
- Analyze at most ${MAX_ADS_PER_READ} ads. If there are more, take the ${MAX_ADS_PER_READ} most prominent and say so in the last entry's replicationNotes.

THEN, FOR EACH AD, report what is ACTUALLY THERE — never invent an element you cannot see:
- Transcribe on-ad copy VERBATIM into each element's "text" (headline, hook, bullets, CTA label, badges). Keep the original line breaks and casing. If an element is absent, omit it rather than inventing it.
- Locate every element by zone and describe its treatment precisely enough to rebuild the layout without the original.
- When type sits inside a coloured block, band, highlight or pill, SAY SO and name that block's colour in the treatment. Highlighting one word of a headline in a hot colour is a deliberate device, and rebuilding the ad without it loses the design.
- Explain the scroll-stop MECHANISM (contrast, face, colour break, type scale) — not praise.
- If an ad is too small or too low-resolution to read its copy reliably, still report the layout and palette, and say so plainly in that ad's replicationNotes rather than guessing at the words.
