/**
 * NEURO — the Predicted Response layer (TRIBE-inspired neural pre-test).

 * TRIBE v2 (Meta) predicts the brain's response to a stimulus before you run it.
 * We can't use that model (CC BY-NC license, and it outputs fMRI voxels, not ad
 * performance), but we CAN port its thesis: score every generated concept on how
 * the human brain is likely to react BEFORE any spend — grounded not in fMRI but
 * in established neuromarketing principles (and, later, in TPB's own outcome
 * data).
 *
 * This is a PREDICTION/ESTIMATE, never measured neuroscience. The UI labels it as
 * such. Like the rest of the retrieval layer it degrades gracefully: it never
 * throws, and falls back to curated principles when the Vault has none.
 *
 * Runs on the cheap intelligence model (Sonnet), not OPUS — it is a structured
 * grading pass, exactly the kind of bulk sub-task the intelligence layers use.

- Visual salience & pattern-interrupt: attention is allocated to novelty and high-contrast change within the first ~50ms. Openings that break the expected scroll pattern win attention; predictable openings get filtered out pre-consciously.
- Processing fluency / cognitive load: messages that are easy to process feel truer and more likeable (the fluency heuristic). One clear idea per beat beats a crowded frame; complexity taxes attention and suppresses action.
- Emotional valence & arousal: emotionally arousing stimuli are encoded more strongly and drive sharing and action far more than neutral information (the affect heuristic). Flat, purely informational creative under-performs.
- Memory encoding / isolation (Von Restorff) effect: a single distinctive, isolated element is remembered better than a list. One bold figure or one named member beats many competing claims.
- First-3-seconds attentional gating: scroll-stopping requires a concrete, specific, curiosity-opening first beat. Vague or generic openers are gated out before the message lands.
- Specificity & concreteness: concrete numbers and named individuals are processed as more credible and more memorable than abstract claims.
- Self-reference effect: creative that makes the viewer feel personally identified ("seen") is encoded more deeply and recalled better.
- Loss aversion & problem framing: the brain weighs potential losses more heavily than equivalent gains; a sharply framed problem can out-pull a gain promise.`
