/**
 * Creative Canvas — precise node regeneration.
 *
 * Regenerates exactly ONE node (a hook, a scene, a CTA …) while holding the
 * rest of the concept constant. The strategy snapshot and the lane's locked
 * neighbours travel with the request so the rewrite stays coherent with the
 * awareness stage, sophistication stage, audience, offer, and brand voice —
 * precision, not a fresh roll of the dice.
 *
 * Degrades gracefully: with no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY it serves a curated TPB
 * alternate so the canvas always works end to end.
